I have been building out a new API. To cut a long story short I needed a data set for some other projects I have on the go and the Veeam KB data seemed a perfect fit, plus I wanted to enhance it (these are the sprinkles) with referenced Veeam R&D forum posts. 

### Goals

- Automatically fetch new KB's that are listed and update ones which have had updates provided to them
- Content scraped must be clean, returned as Markdown through the API
- Retain as many of the sections as we can (Problem, Solution etc) as well as provide a full version
- Detect products and versions referenced so we can list applicable products and provide search function in the future
- Find any references in the Veeam R&D Forums, store this information and reference against any of the KB(s) that are linked so you can see any discussion along side the KB
- List API endpoint that can returns KB Articles, paginated, light weight
- Detailed endpoint showing the detailed KB information, any sections plus the full version as well as the enhanced data from the products and related content (Veeam R&D forums) discussion

At first I thought, should be simple enough but as I got into it a few challenges presented itself.

### Challenges

**There is no API to fetch the KB detail**
But there is one to get the list of KB numbers with a small amount of data - this is good as i don't need to slam the Veeam web server to find out if a new KB exists by guessing the number, these usually increment in 1's but not always. Regardless, this is more efficient for us.

**The HTML is pretty bloated**
When scraping the data for each KB article, the body content of the KB detail itself is fairly typical of a big CMS. 

There are loads of nested divs, style classes etc. I really want clean content to work with but still maintain the sections (like Problem, Solution etc). Stretch goal was to also have this in clean markdown format so this needed a bunch of work.

A bunch of other elements are baked through there which were unnecessary so I ended up having a blacklist of elements/class combos that were removed from the DOM before conversion.

**The content contains inline forms**
Baked in and around the main body are a few forms we need to detect and get rid of from the DOM before converting, one is typically a notify me form and the other being a feedback for mistakes in the content.

**Markdown conversion**
After cleaning the HTML, conversion to markdown mostly worked but there was a couple of items that needed manipulating before parsing the HTML > Markdown.

- Images are referenced as <picture> elements which contains multiple image sources optimised for different screen resolutions or formats. This does not play nicely with conversion. So I loaded the HTML and manipulated it by detecting these, removing the element from the DOM, finding the biggest image source and then inserting a new image into the DOM in it's place with the reference of the biggest image
- Often the nested div structure wrecked havoc with the conversion so a few regex replacements of tabs/new lines in some conditions were required to clean it up and the markdown to work correctly 

### Result

Well you can be the judge of it but I am happy and all of the items I wanted Â for this first version.

**Examples**

GET to https://veeamkb-api.betagrounds.dev**/api/KBArticle/list**
Will return an array (including some pagination data) with the following data objects

    {
          "id": "64634cd8a52f5b7bf625f11c",
          "kbId": "kb4442",
          "title": "SharePoint backup jobs fail with: The remote server returned an error: (429)",
          "productsReferencedCount": 1,
          "relatedContentCount": 2
        }
    
    
    ```
    
    At a glance you can see the title, as well as the count of products referenced, and related content. Let's take a look at the detailed now.
    
    GET to https://veeamkb-api.betagrounds.dev**/api/KBArticle/kb4442**

        Some points of note other than the obvious
        
        - The related content shows links to the R&D forums, plus a little intro description
        - The products array is the related product name/version combo found
        - The detail.....Mdx sections are where we are trying to detect the different sections, where null, this is where that doesnt existing for that KB - the format varies a lot. The one above has Challenge and Solution
        - You can get the full Markdown response int he detailFullMdx which can be rendered for example as below 
        
        ![](/content/images/2023/05/image-2.png)
        That about sums it up, there are a few other endpoints available which will be obvious if you hit them.
        
        For now, you can ignore the create/update endpoints, these are behind some auth.

        ### Future enhancements
        
        - Twitter Bot, automatically post new or updated KB's to Twitter
        - Create a new concept UI to consume this API
        - Allow users to register a web hook endpoint so we can push new or updated KB's to them (i.e Teams, Slack etc)
        - Write a command line cli tool so you could type "veeam-kb 4414" and have it return markdown rendered in your terminal, example below;
