Vanguard intakes only happen once a year and you typically submit your application in December and it takes a couple of months for the team at Veeam to process all of the applications and consider renewals (like me) and new applicants.

Well that day has come - my alarm went off and I flipped open my email and to my absolute delight I have been renewed into this fantastic tech programme again in 2022.

This year there are 65 of us so the group is still a tight bunch of people from all over the world who love working with Veeam products and their wonderful staff. 

This year hopefully I will be able to attend the summit in Prague - I did not get there the last two years due to covid border restrictions here in New Zealand. Fingers crossed! 

### Highlights of 2021

I had some time to think about my highlights from the 2021 year, other than various blog post I am most proud of

- Invited to and presented at the A/NZ All Hands Presentation for Q3 around service provider observations in the market
- I created a demo environment and presented at the A/NZ Veeam v11 launch on Instant DB Recovery
- I attended and presented at a bunch of Veeam User Groups 
- I presented to fellow Vanguards in a two part series on how to build API's and code against Veeam products 
- I was invited to attend the VCSP Tech Summit Invite allowing service providers to directly feed back about our experiences with Veeam
- I created a cool [Christmas demo website and API](/creating-a-christmas-cracker-alarm-dashboard-for-veeamone/) for VeeamONE alert push (veeamonereceiver) for Veeam User Groups

So quite the year, what will 2022 bring?

There are some things in the pipeline already but i hope to start getting some video content going as well as a few in person events, let's see what happens.

Thanks again to the amazing Nikola Pejkova, Rick Vanover, Danny Allan and the entire product strategy / technologist team for making this Vanguard programme happen.
