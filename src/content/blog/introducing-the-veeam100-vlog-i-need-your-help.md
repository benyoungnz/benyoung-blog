We are around 2 weeks out from me starting the long journey to Prague for my first summit. Covid got in the way the last couple of years so I could not be more excited to meet the wider Vanguard (and now Legend) family and spend some time in person.

I figure it might be a switch up a but from the written form of content and lets try my hand at some video content in for form of a vlog.

I would love your ideas for things you may want to see, people you may want to hear from, places or landmarks in Prague, food etc 

Ping them to me via [@benyoungnz](https://twitter.com/benyoungnz) on Twitter, or via the YouTube comments

See you for episode #1 in a wee while
