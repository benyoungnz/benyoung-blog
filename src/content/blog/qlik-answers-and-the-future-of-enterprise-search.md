The average employee spends around an hour a day looking through documents, emails, systems looking for answers - this is often like finding a needle in a haystack. Traditional search only goes so far which is why the world is so excited about the prospect of Generative AI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

We all can agree that LLMs are powerful tools that can generate text, translate languages, and even write different kinds of creative content. But LLMs on their own are not enterprise solutions out of the box.

One major trend in making these ready for the enterprise is through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  While LLMs are impressive,  they lack the crucial ingredient for in making them successful: **understanding your specific data**.  

To make this as simple as possible for businesses to get started they have launched **Qlik Answers** which is a next-generation knowledge platform that leverages the power of LLMs combined with the richness of your enterprise data.

It's a turnkey solution, Simply add your data by manually uploading a dataset or by leveraging their growing number of enterprise connectors such as that into SharePoint. You can then sit back as the complexity around document chunking strategies, vector databases, reranking, which models to use and all of the required cloud infrastructure is taken care of.

**Here's why Qlik Answers is exciting:**

- **The Information Deluge:**  Did you know employees spend a staggering amount of time – roughly an hour a day – searching for information buried in unstructured data like emails, documents, and reports?  Qlik Answers cuts through the noise, delivering **targeted answers**.
- **Trustworthy Insights:** Reliable answers are paramount.  Qlik Answers goes beyond just providing results; it surfaces the **original source documents** for complete transparency and user confidence in what is being generated.
- **Departmental Expertise:**  One size doesn't fit all.  Qlik Answers allows for the creation of **individual answer engines** tailored to specific data types and departments.  Imagine a marketing-focused engine that understands marketing and delivers relevant results for marketing teams.
- **Unified Copilot Experience:**  The future of work is streamlined.  Qlik envisions a world where users interact with a **single, unified system** to access all their intelligent assistants, eliminating the need to jump between different applications.

**How Qlik Answers works:**

1. **Create Your Bot:**  It's easy to set up a custom assistant.
2. **Connect the Data:**  Import existing files directly (they'll be added to your Qlik catalog) or leverage data connectors like SharePoint.
3. **Intelligent Indexing:**  Qlik Answers efficiently organizes your data using best practices and prioritizes the most relevant results.
4. **Double-Checking the Best:**  The system employs a two-step retrieval process, first identifying potential matches and then reranking them to ensure the absolute best answer surfaces, even if it wasn't the initial top pick.

**Qlik Answers** is a glimpse into the future of enterprise search.  By harnessing the power of Generative AI and contextual data, it empowers users to find the information they need quickly and confidently, unlocking a new era of data-driven decision making.
