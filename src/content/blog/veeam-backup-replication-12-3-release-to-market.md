#### Agents

##### Agent Management

Windows agents now support the `matchbackupserver` parameter for the `setVBRsettings` command, letting preconfigured agents retain settings as long as the backup server stays the sameâ€”no reconfiguration needed.

##### Veeam Agents for AIX and Solaris

*   Direct File Recovery: Restore files directly to the target host for faster, more secure recoveries.
*   Publish Backup: Access backup disks directly on the target system for tasks like bulk recovery or scanning. Changes are discarded when the backup is unpublished.

##### Veeam Agent for Mac

Smarter Backups: The agent now detects macOS Low Data Mode and hotspots, avoiding metered networks for more efficient backups.

##### Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows

*   Effortless Bare Metal Recovery: Recovery just got a whole lot easier. You can now automate the process using answer files, skipping the need for manual inputs or extensive training. This means faster restores to original or even different hardwareâ€”less stress for admins, more productivity for users.
*   Bare Metal Recovery from Manual Copies: Got a backup on a USB or other local storage? Now you can restore directly from it without needing a network connection to your repository. Super handy for those tricky situations!
*   Smarter Backup Network Detection: If your machine has multiple network interfaces, thereâ€™s a new tweak to help backups pick the fastest route. Itâ€™s not on by default (we donâ€™t want to surprise you in a minor release), but itâ€™s a registry-setting away from optimizing data flow and boosting performance.
*   Hiding Repository Sizes for Managed Agents: To save admins from awkward "Are we running out of space?" questions, weâ€™ve hidden repository size and capacity details from end users. Admins know bestâ€”problem solved.
*   Expanded GFS Configuration Options: Aligning long-term retention with company policies just got more flexible. You can now fine-tune GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) settings to specify which weeks you want for monthly backups.
*   GFS Restore Point Notifications: No more guessworkâ€”job logs now clearly show when a GFS restore point is created, keeping you in the loop.

#### Enterprise Applications

##### General

*   Preferred Network Selection: Route backup traffic over dedicated networks for faster RPOs without affecting other workloads.
*   Faster Database Restores: Asynchronous read improvements make Oracle, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL restores up to 2x faster.

##### Microsoft SQL

Supports SQL Server Management Studio 20 and OLE DB Driver 19, including strict mode setups.

##### Oracle

Now supports Windows servers with multiple Oracle homes and simplifies corrupted block recovery with RMAN.

#### Backup Appliances

For **Google Cloud**, backup appliance deployment just got simpler. You can now spin them up straight from the backup console using Marketplace imagesâ€”no custom setups needed. Itâ€™s quicker, more secure, and keeps things consistent, reducing errors and making your deployments more reliable. Plus, thereâ€™s expanded support for **Cloud SQL**, now covering SQL Enterprise edition and PostgreSQL v16. Oh, and security? Updated across the board, with the latest versions of .NET, PostgreSQL, and Ubuntu.

For **oVirt KVM** (covering RHV and OLVM platforms), you can now restore backups from virtually anywhereâ€”physical, virtual, or cloudâ€”directly to these hypervisors. This rounds out the Data Portability matrix, meaning full compatibility across the board. 

## Scale-out Backup Repository

**Migration just got a lot easier. **You can now mix extents from different object storage systems or with varying immutability settings within the same Performance and Capacity tiers. This means smoother transitionsâ€”whether you're switching to a new cloud provider or upgrading to immutable storage. Just seal the existing extents before adding new ones, and youâ€™re set. 

**Encryption is now more flexible**. You can configure it directly at the Archive Tier, especially useful if youâ€™re bypassing the Capacity Tier. Previously, youâ€™d need to enable encryption in the backup job, which could disrupt deduplication in the Performance Tier. Now, you can encrypt backups only when theyâ€™re offloaded to the Archive Tier, giving you precise control.

**Support log collection is simpler too.** Instead of manually gathering logs from every server and job involved, you can now collect all relevant logs for a scale-out repository in one step, speeding up troubleshooting and reducing back-and-forth with support.

#### Storage Integrations

##### Object Storage

*   Automatic Bucket Provisioning: Some S3-compatible storage solutions struggle when buckets grow too large. To fix this, standalone object storage repositories can now auto-create new buckets based on the number of workloads protected. This reduces metadata database strain and improves performance. You can enable this for existing repositories, but it only applies to new workloads. Ensure your storage permissions allow for bucket creation and deletion. Check with your vendor before enabling, as some storage solutions handle this natively.
*   Background Checkpoint Removal Improvements: Updated timeout settings and more detailed error reports help diagnose object storage issues. Plus, checkpoint removal severity is now a warning (not an error), with the option to downgrade it further via a registry key.
*   SOSAPI Expansion: Nutanix AHV, Red Hat Virtualization, and Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager backups now leverage extended SOSAPI capabilities for better integration.
*   11:11 Cloud Storage: Integrated directly into the backup console for a smoother experience.

##### Secondary Storage

*   Dell Data Domain: Now supports DD OS up to version 8.1 with the latest DD Boost SDK.
*   HPE StoreOnce for Proxmox: Experimental support for Catalyst-powered backup copy jobs between Catalyst Stores is now available.

##### Tape Enhancements

*   Faster NAS Backup to Tape: Optimized read patterns and caching boost performance, especially for deduplicating storage. 
*   Granular Retries: Failed tasks are retried individually, reducing resource usage and improving efficiency.
*   General Improvements: Resolved edge-case issues for smoother NAS Backup to Tape operations. Version 12.3 is recommended for all users.
*   Resizable Tape Dialog: Tape media properties are now easier to view with a resizable dialog.

#### Backup Console

*   Performance Upgrades: Stability and speed improvements reduce resource consumption based on user feedback.
*   Database Logs Collection: You can now include PostgreSQL logs in the Export Logs wizard for better troubleshooting.
*   Quicker Help Access: The Help menu links directly to the Backup & Replication documentation. Press F1 for context-sensitive tips.

#### Enterprise Manager

*   Restore To: This feature, previously only in the console, is now in the web UI. Restore to any Windows server for added flexibility.
*   Better Restore Point Selection: Tooltips now show job names to help you pick the right restore point faster.
*   Secure LDAP Support: Enterprise Manager now supports secure LDAP for encrypted domain controller connections.

#### Service Providers

##### VMware Cloud Director

*   Self-Service Disaster Recovery: The Cloud Director Self-Service portal now lets tenants manage disaster recovery on their own. They can initiate failovers for VM snapshot-based replication jobs and CDP policies without needing provider assistance. Plus, tenants can configure VM snapshot-based replication jobs directly, giving them more control and flexibility.
*   Malware Detection: Malware scanning is now available for Cloud Director VM backups. Tenants can choose from YARA rule-based scans or signature-based antivirus options, including Veeam Threat Hunter. This lets service providers offer an extra layer of security by detecting active malware or dormant threats in client backups.

##### Veeam Cloud Connect

*   CDP Replica Testing: With v12.3, tenants and providers can now run test failover plans to verify CDP replica recoverability. The best part? Testing doesn't disrupt ongoing CDP replicationâ€”it runs smoothly in the background.
*   Expanded Restore Options: Service providers can now restore tenant backups directly to AWS EC2 or Microsoft Azure IaaS. This opens up new service possibilities and helps maximize value from hyperscaler contracts.

#### Rest API

Continually expanding, Veeam's REST API gives you more control and automation over your backup and restore processes.

New in 12.3:
