**Data isn't just fuel for AI—it's rocket fuel!**

The AI revolution has organisations focused on making fresh data accessible. But the real competitive advantage lies in something most companies already have but can't access easily. Your archives spanning years, sometimes decades of "organisational memory".

What if a platform could provide instant access to data both historical and near-real-time to AI systems all with zero data movement costs? Well, read on. 

## Enterprise data == AI context

Your enterprise archives don't just contain information. They contain *context*. A complete history of your business, patterns across market cycles, customer interactions all spread across various platforms and systems.

Not to mention crazy amounts of unstructured data in the form of documents, presentations, videos, audio. All of which AI systems can consume like a high octane engine. 

**Veeam has been protecting this data ecosystem for a long time.** From virtual machines and physical servers to cloud workloads, databases and file shares. We even followed you as you moved data to SaaS through applications like Microsoft 365 and Salesforce. 

We continue to build comprehensive coverage that captures your estate.

Traditional approaches for getting access to this goldmine of data through to AI systems require time intensive restoration processes that can take hours or days not to mention the capacity to store this while you AI pipelines process the data. But here's what most don't realise **the technology to unlock the mine doors already exists, battle-tested in production environments, hidden in plain sight behind traditional recovery functionality.**

## Years of Innovation Has Led To This Moment

### The Foundation? Veeam Instant Recovery Technology
**For years, Veeam has been perfecting technologies that seemed designed for disaster recovery which turns out were really accelerators for the AI era.** Veeam instant recovery capabilities each release continues to grow, today we support this technology — for unstructured data of NAS/Fileshares, VMs and even individual disks from these machines. This represent years of research and development into making protected data immediately accessible without traditional restore operations.

Happy accident? Perhaps.. but more accurately, it was the furious innovation of our product teams and executive buy-in driven by the conviction that instant access to data would eventually become mission-critical.

### Say Hello To Your New Best Friend, The Veeam Data Integration API
Released in Veeam v10.. yes, that long ago. I even [blogged about it](https://benyoung.blog/blog/getting-started-with-the-veeam-data-integration-api/) in a prior life all the way back in 2020! 

**After extensive R&D, the Data Integration API represents the culmination of years of innovation in making data accessible.** This isn't a new feature bolted onto existing technology, or something we rushed to market during the AI hype cycle it was a natrual evolution of our product.

The technology presents protected data directly to any system using standard iSCSI or FUSE protocols, for the non-technical folk this means almost any system can have your data presented. Instantly. 

Your AI infrastructure sees this as normal block storage, no fancy drivers or access requirements making it adaptable to a wide array of AI systems. 

Put another way, the business impact is transformative. Comprehensive data access across your protected estate with **zero data movement costs** for accessing this data. Multiple systems can instantly scale to access different data sets simultaneously, while complete data integrity is maintained through read-only access that protects your archives. 


## Complete Enterprise Data at AI Speed

Most organisations talk about being "AI-ready" focused on making current data accessible. **But what if you could access both current and historical data from a single system?**

Veeam customers have access to something ~~fundamentally different~~ special. Unprecedented access to their all of their enterprise data. **From the latest restore points, potentially being captured multiple times per day to decades of organisational memory**, all instantly accessible to AI pipelines without traditional data movement constraints.

To be clear, this isn't just about mining historical data, although immense value can be extracted from these. Your AI systems can analyse today's backup alongside last year's restore points. Think about how powerful that is for a moment. 

Imagine what mining decades of emails, documents, and communications to discover could uncover or power, analyse years of customer correspondence to identify patterns, insights from historical contracts and reports, and build comprehensive knowledge graphs from years of unstructured content to unlock endless possibilities.

Veeam provides unified, instant access to an organisation's data, which is AI-ready.

## The Future Is Already Here

The AI revolution isn't a roadmap item for our customers, they already have access to it. While others are still trying to to make their current data AI-accessible, you can already be training models, building chat systems and data mining on your unstructured data.

One of the biggest success factors for any AI application depends on having access to data. Stop thinking that your backup repositories are just useful for disaster recovery. They are your AI competitive advantage waiting to be unleashed.

## The TLDR;
AI advantage doesn't come from having the latest models or the most compute power. It comes from having access to data that tells the complete story of your business, your customers, and your market.

While everyone else was preparing for the AI revolution, Veeam was already building it.
