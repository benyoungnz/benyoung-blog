What if I told you you can talk to your backup server? Gain insights and drive actions. All with no trickery, no pre-exported datasets - in real time, via the Veeam Backup VBR API?

Well today I am presenting a small working proof of concept that I developed during the Veeam 100 Summit in Prague this week. 

I can't wait to give it some more super-powers, but let's take a look at what data it has access to before we dive into some sample "discussions" I had with my home lab back home from Prague Airport.

### Tech stack and notes

- This uses the [**Veeam VBR Rest API**](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vbr_rest/overview.html?ver=120)
*I have talked many times about this before.*
- The prototype is **built with Node.js**
*It provides the local API the frontend talks to, and makes required calls to my VBR server and OpenAI.*
- **OpenAI** is providing the model*, specifically, Â gpt-3.5-turbo-0613

*I am wanting to try this with a locally hosted model - given the potentially sensitive nature of backup server data a local model I believe will be the default for most - but for a prototype and my lab environment I am comfortable using this solution for now. 

### Skills it has

To provide this demo I focused on Backup Jobs and Backup Sessions and it talks to 4 VBR Rest API endpoints for this. 

Obviously needs to be expanded but this gives us a good feel for the possibilities we have now we can bridge real time data from an API with a LLM.

- /api/v1/jobs (Fetch all jobs)
- /api/v1/jobs/states (Fetch all job states)
- /api/v1/jobs/${id}/start (Start a job with a given ID)
The ID is not hard coded, the LLM works out what what the backup job ID is and pulls this from the backup job json returned and passes it to this endpoint as required.
- /api/v1/sessions (Fetch backup sessions)

### Demo

It's a bit slow as I am on 4g at the airport and the B&R server is a on the other side of the world but it works well enough.
