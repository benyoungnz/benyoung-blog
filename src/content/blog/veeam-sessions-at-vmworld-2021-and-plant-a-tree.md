Hey, did you know vmworld is running virtually again in 2021 from October 5th to 7th? It's free by the way.

Also did you know they will be planting a ðŸŒ² for every attendee registered this year? Although there are no official stats from last year around number of attendees there was 20k companies in attendance and over 12,500 hands on labs were delivered... so.... let's just guesstimate somewhere between the two. Either way its good for planet earth ðŸŒŽ

### Untangle the Kubernetes and Data Conundrum with Veeam [MCL2833S]

**Michael Cade**

*New platforms, models and applications are the standard today. In this session, Veeam will take the fear out of protecting VMware workloads on premises, in the cloud and running Kubernetes while preserving complete mobility of your data. Whether you need to migrate an application to the cloud, provide better availability on premises, or protect Kubernetes applications in VMware vSphere, Veeam has you covered for any workload, even business-critical ones.*

### Designing for Disaster: Design vSphere for Disaster Recovery with Veeam [MCL2834S]

**Melissa Palmer**

*Disasters come in all shapes and sizes. From full site and storage array failures to natural disasters you can or canâ€™t predict, or even malicious actors inside your environment, your business is at risk. Whatever the case, you need a plan, and all disaster recovery plans are not created equal. But how do you ensure your VMware vSphere infrastructure is designed to ensure recovery? Join Veeam to learn how to avoid these dastardly deeds and ensure all workloads can be quickly recovered.*

### Quell Cloud Chaos: Data Protection for Any VMware Cloud Solution with Veeam [MCL2832S]

**Anthony Spiteri / David Hill**

*In a multi-cloud world, not one cloud offering suits every workload. How do you ensure your data can be backed up and recovered for every workload, even across disparate cloud offerings? Veeam delivers modern data protection across any VMware offering, including the cloud and on premises. This session will tour how cloud technologies can be consumed through the VMware technology ecosystem.*

### Integrating Backup Into Your GitOps CI/CD Pipeline [CODE2809]

**Michael Cade**

*The ability to deploy code and version code has been a de facto requirement and a reason we have CI/CD pipelines for our application development, but with Kubernetes in particular we are seeing a closer tie between code and data. In particular, code being deployed can affect and change your data, for that reason, we need to consider protecting that data as part of our Continous Development pipelines, In this session, we will focus on how we can incorporate backup actions into your pipeline to ensure that any code changes will start by creating a restore point be it a snapshot or an export to another external repository. We will then as part of a demo incorporate a failure scenario into the environment pipeline to simulate how a configmap can manipulate data to cause data loss. Then we need a way to bring the data back!*

### Terraform for VMware Environments - A Sysadminâ€™s View [VMTN2803]

Razvan Ionescu

*Have you ever wondered what is Terraform and what does it have to do with your vSphere environment? In this session you will get a short and fast intro into key concepts of immutability, infrastructure as code and how to apply it to a traditional vSphere infrastructure. You will also hear about a few hard learnt lessons.*

### Cost-effective Backup, Disaster Recovery and Cyber Recovery in IBM Cloud [MCL3195S] (Sponsored)

Sam Fischer / Debbie van Zyl (IBM)

*IBM Cloud VMware Solutions offer cost-effective backup, disaster recovery and cyber recovery solutions through a Shared/vCD offering. By using VMware together with a strong partner network, IBM Cloud is able to deliver a complete solution that ranges from self-managed to fully managed depending on the customer's preference.*
