Veeam have just launched a new "ransomware warranty" - it's an interesting move and perhaps a good option for organisations who need piece of mind but are struggling to get, or struggling to get their traditional insurers understand this type of insurance.

As part of this warranty you are not only going to get funding to cover the cost of data recovery (capped) but you also get a bunch of other resources such as quarterly health checks and access to experts trained in the these types of ransomware attacks, I have seen this referred to in the market today as the "SWAT" team.

### What does it include?

- Advanced onboarding support
- A 30-minute time-to-first-response support service level (SLA)
- A dedicated support account manager (SAM) for assistance and escalation
- Quarterly health checks for best-practice operations, these checks validate the health of your environment based on Veeam’s guidelines, and will identify any gaps that need to be addressed.
- Design and Installation services through a Veeam Accredited Service Provider
- In the event of a ransomware attack, Veeam will cover the cost of data recovery, up to $5 million

### How/when can it be activated?

Per the terms and conditions effectively this is  this is what constitutes activation of the warranty

1. Malware from an unauthorized source infects your system 
2. Your files are encrypted and unusable and;
3. Payment is requested from the cybercriminal in exchange for access to your unencrypted data.

### Who is eligible?

The "Eligible Solution" refers to the software and services included in the Veeam Data Platform "Premium Edition" with Veeam Premier Support. To be eligible, the solution must have a Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of at least $200,000 ACV, cover the entire customer production environment, and have a subscription term of at least three years.

TLDR;

> Veeam Data Platform, Premium Edition > MSRP $200,000, subscription term of no less than 3 years + Veeam Premier Support

This is detailed more in the terms and conditions linked below

### Terms and conditions

Of course there are some, but ill be honest - it is one of the easier reading terms and conditions documents out there - but have a read [through the fine print](https://www.veeam.com/products/ransomware-recovery-warranty-terms-conditions.html?ad=in-text-link)
