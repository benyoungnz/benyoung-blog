Another year around the sun and the Vanguard 2024 class has been announced!

This year I am calling the series **"Wavelength", **a move away from quite a dark theme last year with a pop of colour. Still abstract though. The neat thing, AI generated part of the wave lenght layers for me.

Everything else is the same as previous with the move to x1,x2, x3 etc for the Twitter banners, and there is still LinkedIn, Meetings and Desktops to be utilised.

As per usual these are all over on [github.com/benyoungnz/vanguard-templates](https://github.com/benyoungnz/vanguard-templates) for cloning or direct download. The PSD files are even there if any Vanguard wants to customise it or add other badges like vExpert etc.
