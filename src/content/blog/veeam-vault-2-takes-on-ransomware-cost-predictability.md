As organizations increasingly turn to the cloud for backup storage to protect them against threats such as Ransomware - which by the way, our [latest trends report](https://go.veeam.com/wp-ransomware-trends-report-2024) shows 93% of ransomware attacks now explicitly targeting backups. When even your last line of defense is under threat, choosing a secure, resilient, and performant storage solution is essential which is where cloud storage comes into play. However, managing costs can become a frustrating challenge. Cloud storage often comes with hidden charges—fees for retrieval, egress, and transactions—that vary across providers and can lead to *unpleasant* surprises. These unpredictable costs make it difficult to budget accurately and leave organizations wary of expanding their cloud footprint.

Veeam Vault v2, which is part of our Veeam Data Cloud portfolio tackles this issue head-on with a simplified, single-rate pricing model. By offering a straightforward and transparent approach, Veeam Vault v2 helps organizations avoid unexpected fees and focus on their core business without worrying about surprise cloud storage expenses.

## Veeam Vault v2: Reliable, Transparent, and Ready for Real-World Needs

Veeam Vault v2 takes the guesswork out of cloud storage costs with its all-inclusive pricing model. Forget the extra fees that usually add up with most cloud providers—this plan covers storage, transactions, and egress all in one rate. For teams managing tight budgets, this kind of predictable pricing is invaluable, allowing for easy planning without surprise bills at the end of the month.

To meet different resilience needs, Veeam Vault now offers two editions: Foundation and Advanced. The Advanced Edition, designed for the highest durability, uses Azure Blob’s zone-redundant storage (ZRS) to ensure "12 nines" of durability, replicating data across three availability zones. For industries with strict compliance requirements, this level of reliability offers peace of mind, ensuring data remains safe even if an entire data center faces an outage.

Backup testing is often limited by cost, but Veeam Vault’s Advanced Edition allows unlimited restores. This means organizations can run as many restore tests as they need without additional fees—a crucial feature for those who need frequent validation to stay compliant. Removing the cost barrier for testing helps teams maintain operational resilience and confidence in their backup integrity.

Finally, Veeam Vault v2 brings cost-effective storage without compromising performance. By leveraging Azure Blob’s cool storage, Veeam Vault maintains the high speed and reliability users rely on for critical backups and restores for when you need it the most, all while optimizing storage expenses.
