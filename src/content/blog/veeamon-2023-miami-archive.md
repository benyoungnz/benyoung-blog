The VeeamON event website will eventually go away so I "borrowed" Â the content. I scraped all of the session into a summary set of markdown documents, all files referenced (presentations) are also downloaded and stored in this archive ðŸ¤˜.

Each session markdown gives you detailed information such as abstract, speakers, and downloadable resources. 

### But why, Ben?!

Well, the bat signal went up in the Vanguard Slack yesterday..... Now we have an archive of the VeeamON sessions from Miami!

No point in embedding much here so head on over to

Either clone it offline, or you can navigate through the Github interface, all markdown files are linked together. 

Enjoy!
